## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- **Data Attributes:** Learned about data attributes (```data-*```) which allow embedding custom data into HTML elements, which can be easily accessed and manipulated using JavaScript with the ```dataset``` property.
- **Fetch API:** Used the Fetch API to make network requests. This returns a ```Promise```, which allows to handle asynchronous operations cleanly.

### Useful resources

- [Using data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Solve_HTML_problems/Use_data_attributes) - This helped me understand the use of data attributes and how to take advantage of the with JavaScript.
- [Making network requests with JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Network_requests) - This is resource explains how to make network requests with JavaScript by using the Fetch API.
